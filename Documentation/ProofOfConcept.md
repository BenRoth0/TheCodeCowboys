# Proof of Concept

## The player finds an item

While traveling to the next location on their map, the player suddenly sees the following message

```
You have stumbled upon a small wooden chest. Do you dare to open it?
```

After selecting yes, the player sees this prompt

```
Inside the chest, you find a _____ (-2 defense) Helmet of ______ (+2 speed)!
```

After naming the item accordingly, the player receives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
         <img src="../BusinessDocs/Miscellaneous/TheBrittleHelmetOfSwiftness.png">
         <p><b> The Brittle Helmet of Swiftness </b></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## The player encounters an enemy

After reaching their destination, the player sees the following prompt:

```
You are suddenly attacked by a _____ (-2 speed) _____ (+1 attack) Orc.
```

The player has a sense of humor and now, after filling in the blanks, must fight:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
         <img src="../BusinessDocs/Miscellaneous/LazyDrunkOrc.png">
         <p><b> A Lazy Drunk Orc </b></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
