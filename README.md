# The Code Cowboys - Senior Project

## Concept: 
In this turn-based mad-lib style adventure browser game, the story is simple, you are an adventurer tasked with working their way through 10 dangerous levels from eerie dungeons to vast forests. Along the way, the player will discover items and monsters. What the player may find cannot be described in any greater detail because it doesn't exist yet! Instead, the player will be asked to provide adjectives to contribute to the item or creature's name. These creatures and items will then come to life with the help of AI image generation. The player must use the items they find to defeat the monsters that stand in their way on their path to victory. Ditch the roleplaying, and embark on a journey filled with... well, whatever you can think of!

## Vision Statement:
Our project is a turn-based roguelike role-playing browser game that incorporates fill-in-the-blank mechanics similar to Madlibs.
We plan to take the user input from various scenarios and use an AI API to generate images that match the input. This will apply 
to the monsters you fight, the player, and the items you receive as rewards. For example, if the player receives a blank Helmet 
of blank that has +2 speed and -2 defense, the player could name it accordingly to the Brittle Helmet of Swiftness. The main goal
will be to complete a series of levels without being defeated by the monsters. Players will be able to navigate through the levels
and choose which location they move to next (a campsite to heal, an event space to trigger a random effect, etc.). The main purpose
of our game is for entertainment. It will be fun and hilarious to see the outcomes of what the player types. We proposed this topic
as each of our team members are interested in game design and we feel that this will help us further our skills in multiple areas.
As far as we are aware, there aren't any existing games or websites that do exactly what we are planning to do. We aim to provide 
a unique experience to anyone who plays our game.
